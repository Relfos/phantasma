      <p>If you have any questions regarding these Terms, please contact PHANTASMA team.</p>
      <p>You and Company agree as follows:</p>
      <h4>Intended Purpose and Use of PHI TOKENS in the Network</h4>
      <p>The intended purpose of the PHI TOKENS is to facilitate the provision and receipt of services (collectively, the "Services") through the software platform currently under development by Company or affiliate thereof that, subject to further development, is intended to provide an innovative market network for crypto investors, employing the best of marketplaces, social networks and SaaS platforms (the "Network"). Specifically, PHI TOKENS are intended to facilitate the provision of Services from Company in the Network to PHI token holders, if successfully completed and deployed, and will constitute proof of prepayment for Services in the Network. The Network is intended to include company provided tools designated for managing and interacting with crypto assets, social network tools which may allow users to share their knowledge and expertise, a market place enabling third party developers to offer their own tools to other users, and various other tools.</p>
      <p>Ownership of PHI TOKENS carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use PHI TOKENS as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the Network, if successfully completed and deployed. In particular, you understand and accept that PHI TOKENS do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share, equity or security or equivalent rights, or any right to receive future revenue shares, intellectual property rights or any other form of participation or governance in or relating to the Network and/or Company and its corporate affiliates, other than rights relating to the potential future provision and receipt of Services in the Network, subject to limitations and conditions in these Terms and applicable Network Terms and Policies (as defined below). The PHI TOKENS are not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any other kind of financial instrument or investment. Protections offered by applicable law in relation to the purchase and sale of the aforementioned financial instruments and/or investments do not apply to the purchase and sale of PHI TOKENS and neither these Terms nor the PHANTASMA.IO Whitepaper constitute a prospectus or offering document, and are not an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer to buy any investment or financial instrument in any jurisdiction. PHI TOKENS should not be acquired for speculative or investment purposes with the expectation of making a profit on immediate resale.</p>
      <p>Additionally, PHI TOKENS do not constitute the provision of any goods and/or services as of the date you agree and accept these Terms, and both parties become bound to the provisions listed herein.</p>
      <p>The Company makes no warranties or representations and offers no guarantees (in each case whether express or implied) that the PHI TOKENS shall confer any actual and/or exercisable rights of use, functionality, features, purpose or attributes in connection with the provision and receipt of the Services in the Network.</p>

      <h4>Scope of Terms</h4>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated herein, these Terms govern only your purchase of PHI TOKENS from us during the Sale Period.</p>
      <p>Any potential future use of PHI TOKENS in connection with providing or receiving Services in the Network will be governed primarily by other applicable terms and policies (collectively, the "Service Terms and Policies"), which will be made
        available on our website, if the Network is successfully completed and deployed. We may add new terms or policies to the Service Terms and Policies in our sole and absolute discretion, and may update each of the Service Terms and Policies
        from
        time
        to time according to modification procedures set forth therein. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Service Terms and Policies, the Service Terms and Policies shall take precedence.</p>

        any
        time in our sole and absolute discretion, in such event the consideration paid by you shall be rejected or refunded.</p>
      <p>At any time during the Sale Period prior to satisfaction of the Completion Condition, Company may either temporarily suspend or permanently abort the token sale for security reasons. During any
        period
        of suspension or in the event that the token sale is aborted, PHI TOKENS will not be available for purchase. Any ether in our possession collected for the purpose of the sale will be returned in the event
      of a cancellation of the sale, minus reasonable network and processing fees.</p>

      <h4>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h4>

      <p> PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS CERTAIN PROVISIONS, SUCH AS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND
        CLAIMS
        WITH COMPANY AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>

      <p>Binding Arbitration. Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, "Disputes") in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
        intellectual
        property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Company (i) waive your and Company's respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these
        Terms
        resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and Company's respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with
        reviewing
        the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>
      <p>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class
        arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of
        individuals.
        Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>
      <p>Arbitration Rules. The enforceability of this Section 14 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, to the maximum extent
        permitted by applicable law.</p>
      <p>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to
        Company
        shall be sent by e-mail to Company at info@PHANTASMA.io. Notice to you shall be either posted on our website or, if available, will be sent by email to any email address you provided in connection with your purchase of PHI TOKENS or use of
        the
        Network or Services. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that you are
        seeking. If
        you and Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date the notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 14, commence an
        arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 14.1, file a claim in court.</p>
      <p>Process. Any arbitration will occur in Seychelles. The arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator agreed to by both parties in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce
        Rules
        of Arbitration, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The courts located in Seychelles will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration decision.</p>
      <p>Authority of Arbitrator. These Terms, the applicable International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration and the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding
        a
        Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a
        class
        arbitration or a representative or class action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual's claims, preside over any type of class or
        representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
      <p>Arbitration Rules. The International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration and additional information about International Chamber of Commerce are available
        at&nbsp;https://iccwbo.org/dispute-resolution-services/arbitration/rules-of-arbitration/. By
        agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the International Chamber of
        Commerce
        Rules of Arbitration and any claim that the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
      <p>Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions. If any term, clause or provision of this Section 14 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent applicable and required by law, and all other
        terms,
        clauses and provisions of this Section 14 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 14.2 above are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as
        prohibited by
        applicable law.</p>

      <h4>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
      <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Seychelles, without regard to conflict of law rules that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the
        Parties
        arising out of or relating to these Terms or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual Disputes or claims) that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved exclusively in the courts of Seychelles.</p>

      <h4>Severability</dih4>
      <p>If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that
        term,
        clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.</p>

      <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to your purchase of PHI TOKENS from us. We may make changes to these Terms from time to time as reasonably required to comply with applicable law or regulation. If we
        make
        changes, we will post the amended Terms and update the "Last Updated" date above. The amended Terms will be effective immediately. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent. Our failure
        to
        exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results
        from
        any cause beyond our reasonable control. Purchasing PHI TOKENS from us does not create any form of partnership, joint venture or any other similar relationship between you and us. Except as otherwise provided in herein, these Terms are
        intended
        solely for the benefit of you and us and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You agree and acknowledge that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide
        to
        you, including these Terms, will be provided in electronic form.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to alter the price of token before the sale starts in response to dramatic market fluctuations.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>

  <h4>Certain Risks Relating to Purchase, Sale and Use of PHI TOKENS</h4>
  <p>Important Note: As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the PHI TOKENS are not being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information presented herein is intended to form the
    basis
    for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are made or intended. Company expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from:
    (i)
    reliance on any information contained herein, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information.</p>
  <p>By purchasing, holding and using PHI TOKENS, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</p>

  <h4>Risk of Losing Access to PHI TOKENS Due to Loss of Private Key(s)</h4>
  <p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of PHI TOKENS stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing LEV
    TOKENS
    may result in loss of such PHI TOKENS. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your PHI TOKENS.</p>

  <h4>Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol</h4>
  <p>Because PHI TOKENS and the Network are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on the Network or PHI TOKENS. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or
    technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the PHI TOKENS and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.</p>

  <h4>Risk of Mining Attacks</h4>
  <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, the PHI TOKENS are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating PHI Token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to
    double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the PHI TOKENS, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving
    Tokens.</p>

  <h4>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</h4>
  <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the PHI TOKENS in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil
    attacks,
    smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of
    the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the PHI TOKENS.</p>

  <h4>Risk of Uninsured Losses</h4>
  <p> Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, PHI TOKENS are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or
    private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
  </p>
  <h4>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</h4>
  <p>The regulatory status of the PHI TOKENS and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology
    and
    its applications, including the Network and the PHI TOKENS. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its
    applications, including the Network and the PHI TOKENS. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Network and the PHI TOKENS in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that PHI TOKENS are a
    regulated
    financial instrument that require registration or licensing. Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
    undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>

  <h4>Risks Arising from Taxation</h4>
  <p>The tax characterization of PHI TOKENS is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing, holding and utilizing PHI TOKENS, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation,
    withholding
    taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.</p>

  <h4>Risk of Alternative Networks</h4>
  <p>It is possible that alternative networks could be established in an attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network
    and
    PHI TOKENS.</p>

  <h4>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Network or Distributed Applications</h4>
  <p>It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more
    generally. Such lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential utility of PHI TOKENS.</p>

  <h4>Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Network</h4>
  <p>The Network is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the PHI TOKENS and Network to follow the specifications set forth in the whitepaper, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those
    ends (subject to internal business description), we may have to make changes to the specifications of the PHI TOKENS or Network for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that the PHI TOKENS or Network, as further developed
    and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be
    adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network and PHI TOKENS.</p>

  <h4>Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ethereum and Other Currency Value</h4>
  <p>The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling PHI TOKENS to fund the maintenance and development of the Network. The proceeds of the sale of PHI TOKENS will be denominated in Ether, and may be
    converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. In addition, some pre-sales of the PHI TOKENS may also be denominated in fiat currencies. If the value of Ethereum or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Sale Period,
    the Company team may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to maintain the Network in the manner that it intended.</p>

  <h4>Risk of Dissolution of the Company or Network</h4>
  <p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ethereum (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the PHI TOKENS' utility due to negative adoption
    of the
    Network, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.</p>

  <h4>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</h4>
  <p>Because PHI TOKENS confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate affiliates, all decisions involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole and absolute discretion, including,
    but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Network, to create and sell more PHI TOKENS for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Network and the PHI TOKENS you hold.</p>

  <h4>Risks Involving Cloud Storage</h4>
  <p>As the Company provides a decentralized cloud storage service to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications, the Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. The Services
    may
    involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services may be interrupted and files may become temporarily
    unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted based on a
    failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the Company's Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may
    face
    additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the Network and therefore the future utility of any PHI TOKENS that you hold.</p>

  <h4>Unanticipated Risks</h4>
  <p>Cryptographic tokens such as the PHI TOKENS are a new and untested technology. In addition there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of PHI TOKENS, including those that the
    Company
    cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed herein.</p>
